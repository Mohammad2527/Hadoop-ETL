This task is part of my university study. In this task, I have used Hadoop tools to automate transformation of data into relational database in Microsoft Azure.
Steps:
1. Creating a user-managed identity to allow the Hadoop cluster to access the data lake storage.
2. Creating a Data Lake Gen2 account on Azure.
3. Setting up permissions for the managed identity on the Data Lake Storage Gen2
4. Creating an SQL Database
5. Creating a Hadoop cluster, using HDInsight
6. Upload the data and staging script
7. Transforming the data using Hive
8. Loading the data using sqoop
